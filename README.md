iOS project
During the work, some of the screen components that were given in the task were implemented:

The hardest part of the lab is dealing with errors and installing a virtual machine.
It took a very long time to install, and during operation it often slowed down and glitched.
After installation there was a problem that the preview timed out and, unfortunately, after trying 3 methods, the error did not go away.
Then I learned to work with code. It was surprising that all the components start from the center of the screen. Moving and counting the correct values ​​using Figma was fun.
When the program slowed down or produced errors, I had to restart the virtual machine, which took 10 minutes.
But what surprised me most was the error on the very last commit, when my repository was “outdated”. After restarting the machine, the problem did not fix itself, so I had to make a new clone of the repository.
